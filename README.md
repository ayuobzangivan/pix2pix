# Pix2Pix Model for Daylighting Prediction

This project provides a Pix2Pix deep learning model implemented in a Jupyter Notebook for predicting daylighting in architectural plans. The model generates visual outputs (images) to represent the daylight performance of various architectural layouts.

## Features
- Predict daylighting performance using architectural plan inputs.
- Supports diverse plan types, shading devices, and orientations.
- Generates high-quality visual results directly in the notebook.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this notebook, ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `tensorflow` (or `keras` if used)
- `Pillow`
- `opencv-python` (if applicable)
- Any other imported library (check the notebook for full requirements).

Install missing libraries using:
```bash
pip install <library_name>



Running the Notebook

    Clone this repository or download the notebook.
    Open the notebook file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
    Run the cells sequentially to train the model or use a pre-trained version.

Input and Output

    Input: Architectural plans with details such as shading type and orientation.
    Output: Predicted daylighting performance as images.

Example Output

Below is an example of the model's output:
